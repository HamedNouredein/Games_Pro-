ðŸš€ Excited to showcase my latest project: Games_Pro â€“ A Game Management Dashboard
Built using ASP.NET MVC, this web application allows users to seamlessly add, edit, delete, and view video games. It offers a dynamic and responsive design with both List View and Card View layouts, providing an intuitive experience for managing game collections. Key features include genre categorization, platform icons, and CRUD operations powered by Entity Framework and SQL Server.

This project not only strengthened my expertise in MVC architecture but also enhanced my skills in database management, responsive UI design, and user experience optimization. Looking forward to hearing feedback and exploring potential collaboration opportunities in web development.

Feel free to check it out and connect! ðŸŽ®ðŸ’»
